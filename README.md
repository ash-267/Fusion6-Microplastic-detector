# Fusion6 – Microplastic Detector  

## 📌 Problem Statement  
**Problem Statement ID:** 25036  
**Title:** Development of Sensor for Detection of Microplastics  
**Theme:** Miscellaneous  
**Category:** Hardware  
**Team:** Fusion6  

## 🌊 Overview  
This project presents a **low-cost and innovative solution** for detecting microplastics in water using the **principle of capacitance change**. Unlike expensive methods such as FTIR and Raman spectroscopy, our solution is simple, scalable, and affordable, making it suitable for real-world water monitoring applications.  

### Principle  
Microplastics (dielectric constant ≈ 2.2) and water (dielectric constant ≈ 80) exhibit different dielectric properties. By measuring the **change in capacitance**, we can detect the presence and concentration of microplastics.  

- Two containers are used:  
  - **Purified water**  
  - **Water + microplastics**  
- Capacitance values are measured and compared.  
- An **AI model** analyzes the difference to confirm microplastic presence.

3. **Capacitance measured** using IC 555 timer–based circuit.  
4. **Data collected** and fed into AI model for analysis.  
5. **Comparison** between clean and contaminated water.
